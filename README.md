# Game of Life

**A Simple Implementation of Conway's Game of Life**

## Overview

This project is an interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. The game is played on a grid of cells where each cell can be either alive or dead based on simple rules.

This was created as my final's project for BME's Programming basics 3 class.
